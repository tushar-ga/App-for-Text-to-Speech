# Speakify_pdf

Our AIM is to develop an application which anyone can use to read a book/pdf with the comfort of a voice assistant.

This application can cater the needs of many students and even appeal to the visually-impaired.

Using Flutter for App Framework and AWS Services for Backend, we have developed this application which can offer the following features :-

1. User Account Creation through Gmail
2. User Data is stored safely in AWS.
3. User can upload any pdf of any choice.(Scanned pdf doesn't work as of now)
4. Common Book Catalog is available for all users.
5. The book can be read in Hindi/English
6. Book section can also be accessed by page number.
7. Voice commands can be given to specify the section the book to be read.
8. If User is not satisfied with the voice assistant response, a list of other possible book sections is also provided.
